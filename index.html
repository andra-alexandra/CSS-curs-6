                  <p class="card-text">Leave it to Christopher John Rogers to create a buzz during New York Fashion Week without even having a show on the calendar. The designer unveils his ready-to-wear collections off-schedule now, but this time around, he went off-script, debuting his first-ever venture into the home universe with a very special and intentional collection of four chairs made in collaboration with Irish furniture purveyors Orior. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Micaiah Carter is at once youthful and wiser than his years. Case in point: The young photographer has already lensed the likes of Pharrell, Zendaya, Missy Elliott, and Jennifer Lopez with a careful composition, intimacy, and striking color balance that both uplifts and celebrates his subjects. Carter’s know-how has made him one of the most in-demand talents in the fashion and editorial sphere, and despite his fast track to the top, he has stayed rooted in family, storytelling, and community building to honor what it means to be a Black American today.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">In a year when we're spending more time at home than ever before, it makes you wonder what celebrities' homes are like. Which Oscar winner has a claw foot tub? Who favors marble countertops over granite? If you've ever paused on a Kardashian's Zoom background or googled Gigi Hadid's NYC apartment design aesthetic, click through to see the best A-list bathrooms.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">When Grace Lynne Haynes was an undergraduate art student, her portraiture professor assigned a simple project: Paint a friend. As she worked on her subject's skin—a color similar to her own—Haynes came to a startling realization. She didn't know how to.
                    "I could paint [white] skin beautifully, nailing all the various undertones," Haynes tells ELLE.com via phone. "But I wasn't taught how to paint Black skin with the same complexities."</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Many of Cartier’s pieces explicitly reference animals. Take the nature-inspired Fauna and Flora collection, or the iconic Panthère watch beloved by It girls from Bella Hadid to Dua Lipa. (The panther has been an emblem of the house dating back to 1914). Keeping that in mind, a recent commission by Fondation Cartier—Cartier’s cultural center dedicated to promoting contemporary art—is a perfect fit. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">en years ago, the property that’s adjacent to my parents’ house became available for the first time in nearly a century,” says real estate developer Paul Arnhold, who grew up in New York City and spent weekends in bucolic Roxbury, Conn., two hours away. Arnhold introduced his husband, Carolina Herrera creative director Wes Gordon, to the area, and he, too, fell in love with the beautiful countryside.</p>
